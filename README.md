# SDI_Capstone_Project

PS 2: Common code for user authentication

Create project templates in multiple common programming languages.

  The template will be a little more than a hello world type template.
  
      It will set up a source code folder structure based on industry best practices and naming conventions.
    
     It will also have some common coding issues resolved such as pulling and parsing the JSON Web Token (JWT) coming in from Keycloak and also have basic read-only      database connections created to the most common databases (Mongo, SQL Server, Postgres, etc).

  This will give new application teams a basic application to get a pipeline created and also a basic web application from day 1 that allows them to log-in and see   data that is being retrieved from a database. So they can remove anything not needed for their use-case and keep all the basics while not having to reinvent the     wheel with every new web application project that comes onboard.
